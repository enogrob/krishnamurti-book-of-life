Create a Mermaid diagram in text format, identifying key concepts, keep their names short,  breaking down these concepts  and their interrelations from the given text based on Jiddu Krishnamurti talks:

What is happening in the world? You have a Christian God, Hindu Gods, Mohammedans with their particular conception of Godâ€”each little sect with their particular truth; and all these truths are becoming like so many diseases in the world, separating people. These truths, in the hands of the few, are becoming the means of exploitation. You go to each, one after the other, tasting them all, because you begin to lose all sense of discrimination, because you are suffering and you want a remedy, and you accept any remedy that is offered by any sect, whether Christian, Hindu, or any other sect. So, what is happening? Your Gods are dividing you, your beliefs in God are dividing you and yet you talk about the brotherhood of man, unity in God, and at the same time deny the very thing that you want to find out, because you cling to these
beliefs as the most potent means of destroying limitation, whereas they but intensify it. These things are so obvious.

To create a Mermaid diagram in text format based on the provided text, I'll break down the key concepts and their interrelations as discussed in Jiddu Krishnamurti's talks. I will keep the names of the concepts short for clarity.
